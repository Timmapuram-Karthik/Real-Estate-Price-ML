## Usage

This project serves as a practical example of data preprocessing, machine learning model selection, training, and evaluation. It also demonstrates effective data visualization using Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The initial analysis includes data preprocessing, feature exploration, handling missing values, and understanding data distributions. Exploratory visualizations highlight trends in property features and their relationships with prices.

## Model Building

The project compares the performance of three machine learning algorithms: Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. Each algorithm's accuracy and Mean Squared Error (MSE) are evaluated to determine the most effective predictor.

## Results

The results section presents the model's accuracy, testing scores, and MSE for each algorithm. It also showcases visualizations of the training and testing scores, as well as feature importance for the Gradient Boosting model.

## Visualizations

The visualizations section includes insightful plots:
1. Count of bedrooms by bedrooms.
2. Average price by property condition.
3. Cumulative bedrooms and condition scores by price range.
4. Cumulative sqft living and basement by price range.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project provides a comprehensive exploration of real estate data analysis and prediction. It demonstrates the significance of machine learning algorithms and effective data visualization in understanding property prices and influencing factors.
